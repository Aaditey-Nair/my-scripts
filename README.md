This github repo contains all my scripts. The scripts are written in Python and Bash. Feel free to download any or all of them. Consider creating aliases for the scripts in the .zshrc or .bashrc files

greet.sh - A fun little script which greets you and gives the current user, directory, time, public and private ip address and weather in your city. Change the location variable to your city of choice

todo.py - A CLI based todo app, complete with add, delete, finish and clear features. Run ```python ./todo.py help``` after downloading the script. By default it will create a new todo_file.txt in your user's home directory.
